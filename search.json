    "section": "",
    "text": "0-16, the worst NFL record possible, has only been attained by 2 NFL teams in history. It was done by the Detroit Lions in 2008, and the Cleveland Browns in 2017. I don’t think there’s any argument that both these teams were awful, but the better question is, who was MORE awful.\nTo figure this out, let’s look at some numbers.\nFirst of all, let’s answer a simple question, which team’s offense moved the ball less? Specifically, which team gained the least amount of yardage throughout their respective season?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(nflfastR)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(waffle)\npbp2008 &lt;-

exact. Being around two full games worth of yardage behind another one of history’s worst teams is not a good look for sure.\nBut hey, that’s just offense. Let’s look at a more balanced between offense and defense stat, turnover differential. Who was the worst at both creating turnovers and holding onto the ball?\n\n\nCode\nLions2008Turnovers &lt;- c(\"Turnovers Recovered\" = 20, \"Turnovers Committed\" = 35)\nBrowns2017Turnovers &lt;- c(\"Turnovers Recovered\" = 13, \"Turnovers Committed\" = 37, 5 )\n\niron(\n  waffle(\n    Lions2008Turnovers,\n    rows = 5,\n    colors = c(\"#0076B6\", \"#A5ACAF\")\n  ) +\n    labs(\n      title = \"2017 Browns defeated by their turnovers\",\n      subtitle = \"Cleveland in '17 had a worse turnover differential than Detroit in '08\"\n    ) +\n    theme(\n      plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n      axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n      axis.title.y = element_blank()\n    ),\n  waffle(\n    Browns2017Turnovers,\n    rows = 5,\n    colors = c(\"#FF3C00\", \"#311D00\",\"white\")\n  ) +\n    labs(\n      x = \"1 square = 1 turnover\",\n      caption = \"By: Tyler Brown | Source: nfl.com\"\n    )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooks like the ’17 Browns are a little worse here. They committed 2 more turnovers, and recovered a WHOPPING 13 less turnovers than the ’08 Lions.\nOkay so the 2017 Browns seem to have been more a little more careless, and definitely way too conservative on defense.\nBoth of these are just individual stats though right? Let’s look into straight up how many points each team scored, and how many points each team gave up.\n\n\nCode\nPointsData &lt;- read_csv(\"FiveThirtyEight.csv\")\n\nLessColumnsPointsData &lt;- PointsData |&gt;\n  select(event_date, season, tm_name, opp_name, tm_score, opp_score)\n\nPointsDataLionsBrowns &lt;- LessColumnsPointsData |&gt;\n  rename(Week = event_date) |&gt;\n  filter(\n    (season == 2008 & (tm_name == \"Lions\" | opp_name == \"Lions\")) |\n    (season == 2017 & (tm_name == \"Browns\" | opp_name == \"Browns\"))\n  )\n\nPointsDataLions &lt;- PointsDataLionsBrowns |&gt;\n  filter(season == 2008) |&gt;\n  mutate(Week = row_number())\n\nPointsDataBrowns &lt;- PointsDataLionsBrowns |&gt;\n  filter(season == 2017) |&gt;\n  mutate(Week = row_number())\n\nPointsDataLionsNew &lt;- PointsDataLions |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Lions_Points_Scored = case_when(\n      tm_name == \"Lions\" ~ tm_score,\n      opp_name == \"Lions\" ~ opp_score,\n    ),\n    Lions_Points_Allowed = case_when(\n      tm_name == \"Lions\" ~ opp_score,\n      opp_name == \"Lions\" ~ tm_score,\n    )\n  )\n\nChartReadyLionsData &lt;- PointsDataLionsNew |&gt;\n  mutate(Team = \"Lions\") |&gt;\n  select(Week, Team, Lions_Points_Scored, Lions_Points_Allowed)\n\nPointsDataBrownsNew &lt;- PointsDataBrowns |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Browns_Points_Scored = case_when(\n      tm_name == \"Browns\" ~ tm_score,\n      opp_name == \"Browns\" ~ opp_score,\n    ),\n    Browns_Points_Allowed = case_when(\n      tm_name == \"Browns\" ~ opp_score,\n      opp_name == \"Browns\" ~ tm_score,\n    )\n  )\n\nChartReadyBrownsData &lt;- PointsDataBrownsNew |&gt;\n  mutate(Team = \"Browns\") |&gt;\n  select(Week, Team, Browns_Points_Scored, Browns_Points_Allowed)\n\nChartReadyLionsData_Long &lt;- ChartReadyLionsData |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(Lions_Points_Scored, Lions_Points_Allowed), \n               names_to = \"Category\", \n               values_to = \"Points\")\nChartReadyBrownsData_Long &lt;- ChartReadyBrownsData |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(Browns_Points_Scored, Browns_Points_Allowed), \n               names_to = \"Category\", \n               values_to = \"Points\")\n\nLionsLineChart &lt;- ggplot(ChartReadyLionsData_Long, aes(x = Week, y = Points, color = Category)) + \n  geom_line() + \n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 50), breaks = seq(0, 50, by = 5)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:16) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Lions_Points_Scored\" = \"#0076B6\", \n                                \"Lions_Points_Allowed\" = \"#A5ACAF\"),\n                     labels = c(\"Points Allowed\", \"Points Scored\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"2008 Lions thrashed by huge blowouts\", \n       subtitle = \"Detroit in 2008 (top graphic) had a hard time reaching anywhere near their opponent's score,\\nwhile Cleveland in 2017 (bottom graphic) stayed closer\",\n       x = NULL, \n       y = \"Points\", \n       color = \"\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(\n      size = 20,\n      face = \"bold\"\n    )\n  )\n\nBrownsLineChart &lt;- ggplot(ChartReadyBrownsData_Long, aes(x = Week, y = Points, color = Category)) + \n  geom_line() + \n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 50), breaks = seq(0, 50, by = 5)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:16) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Browns_Points_Scored\" = \"#FF3C00\", \n                                \"Browns_Points_Allowed\" = \"#311D00\"),\n                     labels = c(\"Points Allowed\", \"Points Scored\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(caption = \"By: Tyler Brown | Source: nflscraPy\", \n       x = \"Week\", \n       y = \"Points\", \n       color = \"\")\n\nLionsLineChart / BrownsLineChart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWow, look at that huge gap each game for the Lions. It looks like they were not even competitive most games, just getting hammered a good percentage of the time.\nAnd look at the Browns. Looks like almost every one of their games was actually pretty tight, implying they were actually competing in a lot of them.\nSo what’s the conclusion here? It looks like the Browns seemed to have thrown away a lot of their games; bad turnover differential and close games, but it seems like the Lions more just could never get anything going; low yardage gained and getting blown out.\nMy conclusion is the 2017 Browns likely made bad decisions and cost themselves a lot of close games, but the 2008 Lions were just simply awful and couldn’t match up with any of their competition. The real losers here?\nThese Team’s Fans…"
