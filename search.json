    "title": "Does Geno Smith deserve to be considered a top tier quarterback?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The comeback of Geno Smith has been an interesting story in the NFL the last couple of years. Geno claims he “ain’t write back though” to all the haters that had already written him off from the start of 2023. His 2023 season was a great sight to see if you’re a Seahawks fan like myself. However this begs the question, is Geno continuing this success into 2024? To go even further, does he deserve to be considered a top tier quarterback?\nTo try and answer this question, let’s look at some 2024 passing data.\nFirst, let’s look at simply passing yards. Who is getting the most passing yards through Week 12 of the 2024 season?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(waffle)\nNFL2024PassingURL1 &lt;- \"https://www.nfl.com/stats/player-stats/\"\nNFL2024PassingURL2 &lt;- \"https://www.nfl.com/stats/player-stats/category/passing/2024/REG/all/passingyards/DESC?aftercursor=AAAAGQAAABlAm4AAAAAAADFleUp6WldGeVkyaEJablJsY2lJNld5SXhOell3SWl3aU16SXdNRFUwTkRFdE5EYzJNaTB3TXpRMExUTmhORFl0TWpZNVpqVmxOV1U0TlRSbElpd2lNakF5TkNKZGZRPT0=\"\n\nNFL2024Passing1 &lt;- NFL2024PassingURL1 |&gt;\n  read_html() |&gt;\n  html_nodes(xpath = '//*[@id=\"main-content\"]/section[3]') |&gt;\n  html_table()\n\nNFL2024Passing2 &lt;- NFL2024PassingURL2 |&gt;\n  read_html() |&gt;\n  html_nodes(xpath = '//*[@id=\"main-content\"]/section[3]') |&gt;\n  html_table()\n\nNFL2024Passing &lt;- bind_rows(NFL2024Passing1, NFL2024Passing2)\n\nTop20NFL2024Passing &lt;- NFL2024Passing |&gt;\n  top_n(20, `Pass Yds`)\n\nGeno &lt;- NFL2024Passing |&gt;\n  filter(Player == \"Geno Smith\")\n\nLamar &lt;- NFL2024Passing |&gt;\n  filter(Player == \"Lamar Jackson\")\n\nJosh &lt;- NFL2024Passing |&gt;\n  filter(Player == \"Josh Allen\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=Top20NFL2024Passing, aes(x=reorder(Player, `Pass Yds`), weight=`Pass Yds`), fill=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Geno, aes(x=reorder(Player, `Pass Yds`), weight=`Pass Yds`), fill=\"#69B140\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Lamar, aes(x=reorder(Player, `Pass Yds`), weight=`Pass Yds`), fill=\"#241773\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Josh, aes(x=reorder(Player, `Pass Yds`), weight=`Pass Yds`), fill=\"#D50032\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Geno Smith soars to the top of the NFL in passing yards\",\n    subtitle = \"The Seattle QB is behind only one of the MVP front runners\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Passing Yards\",\n    caption = \"By: Tyler Brown | Source: nfl.com\"\n  ) +\n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 15),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWow! Geno is above tons of big names like Patrick Mahomes, Joe Burrow, and Josh Allen. He sits only 18 yards behind one of the MVP front runners in Lamar Jackson.\nHowever, there is something else that might be playing a role here. Seattle has one of the most pass first offenses in the league. That may contribute to why Geno gets so many yards. Because of that, let’s look at something maybe more indicative of QB ability regardless of the type of offense, touchdown vs interception ratio. We’ll compare Geno to the two MVP front runners, Lamar Jackson and Josh Allen\n\n\nCode\nGenoTDInt &lt;- c(\"Touchdowns\" = 12, \"Interceptions\" = 12, 4)\nLamarTDInt &lt;- c(\"Touchdowns\" = 25, \"Interceptions\" = 3)\nJoshTDInt &lt;- c(\"Touchdowns\" = 18, \"Interceptions\" = 5, 5)\n\niron(\n  waffle(\n    GenoTDInt,\n    rows = 3,\n    colors = c(\"#69B140\", \"#002244\",\"white\")\n  ) +\n    labs(\n      title = \"Geno throwing the ball away instead of scoring TDs\",\n      subtitle = \"Smith is scoring less and throwing more interceptions than Jackson and Allen \"\n    ) +\n    theme(\n      plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n      axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n      axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n      plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12)\n    ),\n  waffle(\n    LamarTDInt,\n    rows = 3,\n    colors = c(\"#241773\", \"#FCB514\")\n  ),\n  waffle(\n    JoshTDInt,\n    rows = 3,\n    colors = c(\"#00338D\", \"#C60C30\",\"white\")\n    ) +\n    labs(\n      x = \"1 square = 1 touchdown or interception\",\n      caption = \"By: Tyler Brown | Source: nfl.com\"\n    )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOuch. Not looking good for Geno here. He has an even touchdown to interception ratio. That is not very good. Lamar Jackson and Josh Allen have him beat here by a lot.\nLet’s look at one more thing. How effective is Geno at getting the ball far downfield, but also connecting with his receivers when doing so?\n\n\nCode\nGeno &lt;- NFL2024Passing |&gt;\n  filter(Player == \"Geno Smith\")\n\nLamar &lt;- NFL2024Passing |&gt;\n  filter(Player == \"Lamar Jackson\")\n\nJosh &lt;- NFL2024Passing |&gt;\n  filter(Player == \"Josh Allen\")\n\nAvgYPA &lt;- mean(NFL2024Passing$`Yds/Att`)\nAvgCmpPCT &lt;- mean(NFL2024Passing$`Cmp %`)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data = NFL2024Passing, aes(x = `Yds/Att`, y = `Cmp %`), color = \"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data = Geno, aes(x = `Yds/Att`, y = `Cmp %`), color = \"#69B140\") +\n  geom_point(data = Lamar, aes(x = `Yds/Att`, y = `Cmp %`), color = \"#241773\") +\n  geom_point(data = Josh, aes(x = `Yds/Att`, y = `Cmp %`), color = \"#C60C30\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 6.992, color = \"black\",size = 1) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 64.524, color = \"black\",size = 1) +\n  geom_text(aes(x = 6.992, y = max(NFL2024Passing$`Cmp %`) + 0.5, label = \"Average Yards Per Attempt\"),\n            color = \"black\", vjust = 0, hjust = 0.55) +\n  geom_text(aes(x = max(NFL2024Passing$`Yds/Att`) - 0.5, y = 64.524, label = \"Average Completion Percentage\"),\n            color = \"black\",vjust = 1.1, hjust = 0.6) +\n  geom_text(data = Geno, aes(x = `Yds/Att`, y = `Cmp %`, label = \"Geno Smith\"),\n            color = \"#69B140\", vjust = -1, hjust = 0.5, size = 3.5) +\n  geom_text(data = Lamar, aes(x = `Yds/Att`, y = `Cmp %`, label = \"Lamar Jackson\"),\n            color = \"#241773\", vjust = -1, hjust = 0.5, size = 3.5) +\n  geom_text(data = Josh, aes(x = `Yds/Att`, y = `Cmp %`, label = \"Josh Allen\"),\n            color = \"#C60C30\", vjust = -1, hjust = 0.5, size = 3.5) +\n  geom_text(aes(x = 8.9, y = 71, label = \"Throwing Long And Connecting\"), \n            color = \"grey\", size = 4, fontface = \"bold\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x = 8.7, y = 55, label = \"Throwing Long And Not Connecting\"), \n            color = \"grey\", size = 4, fontface = \"bold\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x = 5.7, y = 55, label = \"Not Throwing Long And Not Connecting\"), \n            color = \"grey\", size = 4, fontface = \"bold\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x = 5.5, y = 71, label = \"Not Throwing Long But Connecting\"), \n            color = \"grey\", size = 4, fontface = \"bold\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n   labs(\n    title = \"Geno launching it downfield and connecting\",\n    subtitle = \"Smith is able to throw it deep and complete passes at a high percentage\",\n    x = \"Yards Per Attempt\",\n    y = \"Completion Percentage\",\n    caption = \"By: Tyler Brown | Source: nfl.com\"\n  ) +\n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 15),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHey, what do you know. He’s pretty good in this category, up in that first quadrant of guys who are able to throw it long and connect with receivers at a high rate. He’s got a better completion percentage than both Jackson and Allen.\nSo what’s the conclusion? It seems that Geno is a pretty good NFL QB. He gets lots of passing yards (even for being in a pass first offense), and has the high completion percentage while throwing it deep to boot. However, he seems to struggle with giving the ball to the other team too much, and with making it to the end zone. It’ll be interesting to see if he can clean up the turnovers and throw some more touchdowns. If he can, he might just earn a spot among the NFL’s top-tier quarterbacks."

They committed 2 more turnovers, and recovered a WHOPPING 13 less turnovers than the ’08 Lions.\nOkay so the 2017 Browns seem to have been a little more careless, and definitely way too conservative on defense.\nBoth of these are just individual stats though right?

It looks like they were not even competitive most games, just getting hammered a good percentage of the time.\nAnd look at the Browns. Looks like almost every one of their games was pretty tight, implying they were actually competing in a lot of them.\nSo what’s the conclusion here? It looks like the Browns seemed to have thrown away a lot of their games; bad turnover differential and close games, but it seems like the Lions just could never get anything going; low yardage and getting blown out.\nMy conclusion is the 2017 Browns likely made bad decisions and cost themselves a lot of close games, but the 2008 Lions were just simply awful and couldn’t match up with any of their competition. The real losers here?\nThese Team’s Fans…"
